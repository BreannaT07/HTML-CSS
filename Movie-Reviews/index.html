<div class="Movie2">
    <h2 class="movie_title">TMNT 2007</h2>

    <img class="movie_image" alt="Movie Picture" src="C:\Users\Senior\Downloads\tmnt.jpg">

    <iframe class="movie_trailer" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLlz_AFcZMA?si=HDWrRocI9zJmi1ug" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p class="movie_review"> Almost every good scene in TMNT is an action sequence and a lot of time and thought has been put into them. So much in fact that none seems to have been spared for the story or any of the other characters.</p>

<div class="Movie3">
    <h2 class="movie_title">Mutafukaz</h2>

    <img class="movie_image" alt="Movie Picture" src="C:\Users\Senior\Downloads\mfkz.jpg">

    <iframe class="movie_trailer" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1Qor3xMfW0?si=1UxzcLl3-SZjbgNi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p> Despite its frenetic pace and Tarantino-level of ultra-violence, this dystopian thriller lags in parts and lacks a cohesive plot, so it will likely only satisfy ardent fans of violent anime.</p>
